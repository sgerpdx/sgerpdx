Hey there, I'm Sam. I enjoy linguistics and donuts and combining diverse influences into UX-driven full-stack apps. Tech that I have worked with includes:    

```[ JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, React.js, Node.js, Express, Jest, React Testing Library, Next.js, Firebase, Supabase, p5.js, PostgresSQL & pgAdmin, Postman, Netlify, Heroku, Vercel, AWS ]```    


Currently I'm iterating through an array of non-code circumstances, so my linked portfolio site (among other things) is a bit out of date. Hopefully I'll be able to return to a more active state here in the near future.  Thanks for stopping by, and have a nice day!
