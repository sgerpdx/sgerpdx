Hellow and welcome, I'm Sam, a full stack engineer interested in building imaginative apps that encourage user interaction and creativity, using a foundation of carefully-considered design and TDD.  

Currently my skillset includes the use of:  
```{ Javascript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js, PostgresSQL, Postman, Netlify, Heroku }```  

I've also worked with API and am currently exploring Ethereum blockchain development using Solidity and web3.js  

My past experience being an accountant and earning a degree in linguistics have instilled in me an analytical attention to detail, and an appreciation for syntax. I love the near-universality of programming languages and their potential to bring us together. My other passions include hiking, music, and danish pastries. Feel free to contact me!
